ðŸ§­ Project Snapshot: memguard (Work in progress)

âœ… What Weâ€™ve Done So Far:
1. Problem: Memory leaks are hard to detect early, tooling is reactive
2. Created structured solution vision(CLI tool that scans, explains, and helps fix leak-prone code)
3. Finalized 10 MVP leak patterns(Stored in Notion with prompt + code examples)
4. Deferred prompt testing(Will be battle-tested later)
5. Created project folder structure with placeholders
