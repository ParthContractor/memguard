## ðŸ§­ Project Snapshot: `memguard` (Work in Progress)

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done So Far

1. Defined the problem: Memory leaks are hard to detect early, tooling is reactive  
2. Created structured solution vision: CLI tool that scans, explains, and helps fix leak-prone code  
3. Finalized 10 MVP leak patterns: Stored in Notion with prompt + code examples  
4. Deferred prompt testing: Will be battle-tested later  
5. Created project folder structure with placeholders  
6. Implemented `patterns.yaml` and `matcher.py` for pattern loading and scanning  
7. Skipped manual testing for now: Will use proper unit tests later
